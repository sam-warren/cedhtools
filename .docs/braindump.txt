2. compute commander_card stats for each week -> need this for synergy score
    - this is a per-commander-per-card view showing statistics temporally
    - card win rate for this commander temporally (what is the average win rate for this card when played with this commander? excluding commander decks of this commander that did not play this card) over time
    - card draw rate for this commander temporally - calculated similarly to above, when included in decks with this commander, how does this card contribute to draws?
    - might need total_wins, total_losses, total_draws for each card in this commander - what should I calculate on the Django side vs. pre-compute?
    - synergy score of this card with this commander, calculated by % of decks that played this card with this commander, minus the % of decks that played this card that could have played this card given color identity besides the commander chosen
    - popularity over time - how many decks with this commander played this card over time?
    - statistical significance tests of calculations need to be done on the Django view side since our sample size changes with each week

3. compute commander stats for each week
    - this encapsulates overall commander statistics temporally
    - commander's win rate over time across all decks that played that commander/pair
    - t-test result of win rate to show statistical significance (does this depend on pod size? how to calculate this?)
    - commander's draw rate over time across all decks that played that commander/pair
    - commander's best match up over time
    - commander's worst match up over time
    - average player elo for each commander by week
    - average win rate per seat position for that commander by week
    - average synergy score of cards played in that commander by week
    - average staple score of cards played in that commander by week
    - commander's staple/synergy split by week (% could show a commander's reliance on staples vs synergy cards in a pie chart)
    - number of unique cards played by decks with that commander by week
    - number of tournament entries with that commander by week (popularity)
    - average win rate per seat position for that commander by week/month/year/period
    - most synergistic cards per week? (how to calculate this?)

4. compute commander agnostic card stats for each week
    - this is a view that shows overall card statistics temporally
    - staple score: what percentage of decks that could have played this card played this card? determined by color identity of commanders vs. color identity of card
    - card's overall quality (what is the average win rate diff. for decks that played this card vs. decks that did not play this card?) over time -> need to be specific about this.
        - the diff is drawn from commander_card_stats - should display the average increase or decrease in each commander's win rate with decks that included this card vs. did not include this card, i.e. does this card increase each commander's win rate on average?
    - card's overall draw rate over time for ALL commander decks - calculated similarly to above - how does this card contribute to draws in all decks?
5. compute cedh stats for each week:
    - this is a view that shows overall cedh statistics temporally
    - best color combination by deck win rate
    - worst color combination by deck win rate
    - best performing cards by card win rate across all decks -> relies on commander_card_stats to aggregate data on all cards across all commanders and find out which cards boost win rates the most across all decks
    - best performing commanders by commander win rate by week
    - top cut conversion rates for each commander by week
    - average win rate for each seat position 1-4 by week
    - can we show percent of games that went to a draw by time period? (how to calculate this?)




    
- moxfield deck view should be a simple layer applied on top of existing commander statistics return. cards included in deck that do not have meaningful statistics should still be returned in the deck view, with no data for statistics
- need to fix scroll view container height between deck and list view
- on a related note, need to seriously optimize front end data fetching / sorting / filtering / rendering... very choppy animations on the stat counters and deck list and deck grid
- get deck name and commander name first, then render deck image and content
- card and table view should have statistical significance indicator -> figure out what this will look like

SOON:

- pipeline design: import scryfall and topdeck data concurrently and when both finish import new moxfield data
- repeating pipeline: import new scryfall data, import new topdeck data, import new moxfield data
- implement tanstack-virtual or virtua? needs investigation
- deck sections should have filter and sort options on grid view
- need to implement more robust error handling coming back from the API - re-implement totally lost card, graceful error alerts (figure out where to put these)
- update chi squared test per mons video
- add t test to commander win rate calculation
- card specific stats url:
    /deck/{id}/card/{uniqueCardId}
    has a back to decklist button that links to /deck/{id}
- for commanders: 
    /commander/{commander ids join}/card/{card id}
    has a back to commander stats button that links to /commander/{commander ids join}
- card view should show:
    win percentage
    draw percentage? need to add calculation to mv?
    statistical significance of calculations
    synergy score
- need to refactor search to be able to search for a specific commander with autocomplete elastic search or a moxfield link
- search should be available in header when not on landing page
- add information page describing restrictions on data and how to interpret statistics
- collapsible tables, collapsible deck grid sections, revert to simpler row calculation by not worrying about putting multiple columns on the same row(?)
- can optimize initial animations by not loading rows images on initial render (collapsed rows and tables) -> Can lazy load the data when the section becomes clicked.
- in deckContent, have a filter option at the top to filter through all cards, only show tables or sections containing those cards
- add image preview to deck list 
- don't cache moxfield decklist, fetch fresh on each render
- add collapse all or expand all button to deck grid and list (deckCotnent)
- add option to sort by section or show all cards for list view
- refresh table and deck grid data on filter change 
- when table filters effective, data does not refresh 


LATER:
- implement synergy score!!! need reference to commanderâ€™s color identity (decks that could play it) (Static from API)
- future opporunity to report the most overperforming and most underperforming cards across all commanders -> how to represent this?
- might need to add card type coding to materialized view and refactor for commander view for more robust API (thinking of /commander route)
- easy url sharing and simple moxfield integration -> moxfield chrome extension??
- statistics over time (weekly? how do we do this?)
- dashboard could also have new! tournaments fetched (recent tournaments)
    if we are only fetching a small amount of data could do it nightly
- MOBILE FRIENDLY!! (do this last, learned from animation hell)
- figure out donate button -> buymeacoffee.com
- design nightly or weekly pipeline
- design initial seed pipeline
- dockerize
- tournament view and bracket breakdown
- create option for abstract data views
