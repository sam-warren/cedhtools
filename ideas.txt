CEDHTOOLS REFACTOR

- instead of getting all of our data directly from moxfield...
- Just store the scryfall ID for relevant cards and link to all pertinent information there.
- moxfield deck hub, moxfield deck authors, moxfield deck tokens, moxfield deck requested authors, are not relevant and never will be for this project. can delete these tables.

- the relevant tables are moxfield_deck, moxfield_board, moxfield_board_card
